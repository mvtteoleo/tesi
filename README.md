This study investigates how anisotropic wall permeability influences turbulent channel flows using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The authors focus on how different permeability orientations affect turbulence characteristics and drag forces.

Key Findings:

- Permeability Orientation Impact: The study reveals that the direction of wall permeability significantly affects turbulence structures and drag. Specifically, increasing streamwise permeability tends to enhance turbulence, leading to higher drag. Conversely, increasing spanwise permeability can suppress certain turbulence structures, potentially reducing drag.

- Turbulence Modification: Anisotropic permeability alters near-wall turbulence dynamics. For instance, higher spanwise permeability dampens near-wall vortical structures, affecting the overall turbulence intensity.

- Drag Reduction Potential: By optimizing the anisotropy of wall permeability, it's possible to achieve drag reduction in turbulent channel flows. This has practical implications for designing surfaces in engineering applications where controlling drag is essential.

This research enhances the understanding of flow behavior over anisotropic porous media and offers insights into designing surfaces for flow control in various engineering applications.
